								<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
								<h3>For Universities</h3>
								<p>Universities or schools interested in working with us typically have questions related to the peculiarities of the Cameroonian educational system and its equivalence to their own system. Questions related to fraudulent certificates also frequently come up. <a href="contact.html">Contact us</a> directly to get answers to all your questions.</p>

								<h3>For Students</h3>
								<h5>Why should you study abroad?</h5>
								<p>As an ambitious person, this is a very important question you should ask yourself. There are many good reasons for doing this. You could learn a new language and gain international experience. If you decide to return home at the end of your studies, your international degree would give you a big advantage in the job market. If you instead decide to establish yourself abroad, studying abroad is an excellent starting point.
								</p>

								<h5>Which country should you study in?</h5>
								<p>In principle you could choose any country. However, due to differences in immigration rules, living costs, academic standards, tuition fees, and future job opportunities, some countries are more attractive than others. You should endeavour to take all these factors into account when making your choice.</p>

								<h5>Which study program should you choose?</h5>
								<p>What are you passionate about? Do you have any specific career goals? These are the main questions which should guide your choice for a study program. Students who are confident about their passions and career goals would then proceed to differentiate between study programs based on tuition fees, the reputation of the school/university and other personal preferences. In case you are not clear about what you are really passionate about or your career goals; we have a process in place to get you started.</p>

								<h5>How do you apply?</h5>
								<p>Once you have settled on a suitable study program, it is time to proceed with your application. Follow all the application guidelines set out by the prospective university religiously. Confirm that you fulfill the admission requirements. Where applicable, check that you have the appropriate language proficiency (TOEFL, IELTS etc.) and standardised tests (GRE, SAT) results. Make sure you certify all the requested documents correctly - this is especially important since it is usual way in which foreign universities can confirm the validity of your certificates. We work with you to help you jump through all the hoops of the application process and lay the foundations for your success.</p>

								<h5>How do you pay for application/registration fees?</h5>
								<p>Some universities/schools charge a non-refundable application fee (by credit card) for processing your application. Similarly, language proficiency tests also require upfront payment of application fees by credit card. You are usually required to pay this fee at short notice. Typically, it is very difficult to pay this fee directly from Cameroon within the time frame. Failure to pay this fee within the specified time frame would invalidate your application. We have a solution to help you comply with the requirements for application fees.</p>

								<h5>Do you qualify for a scholarship?</h5>
								<p>Several universities offer scholarships. Full scholarships are scarce to come by and very competitive. On the other hand, most universities have various forms of partial scholarships. Obtaining a scholarship is not based solely on grades. Other factors also come into account like talents, work experience, age, location etc. Based on your previous study results and overall profile, we can give you tips and tricks on how to get appropriate scholarships.</p>

								<h5>How do I finance my studies?</h5>
								<p>Most embassies and/or consulates require evidence of sufficient finances through out your studies in order to grant you a visa. This is usually done by presenting a block amount in a bank account in the hosting nation or an affidavit of support signed by a competent authority of the hosting nation. We can provide advice and solutions to those students who find it hard to deal with this step of the study abroad journey.</p>
