									<h3>What problems do Cameroonian students wishing to study in Europe face?</h3>
									<p> Universities in Europe routinely struggle with attracting and selecting suitably qualified international students for their study programs. Everyone knows about the famous universities in the UK; those universities don't struggle with attracting students. They receive thousands of applications from very desperate students who compete for very limited places. Additionally these universities charge crazy tuition fees; we can't count the number of times we have come across students who have been granted an admission but can't pay the tuition fees. Meanwhile, there are hundreds of interesting degree programs offered by universities all over Europe. These degree programs and the exciting career options they open up are unknown to a large number of prospective applicants. Those are the universities we partner with - currently we work with universities in Belgium, Germany, Portugal, Czech Republic and Lithuania. The feedback we have gotten son far suggests that about 70% of applicants from Cameroon send in incomplete applications for admission. Furthermore, from our experience, those who manage to file their applications for admission correctly usually fail to present themselves in the best light possible. This is where we come in - we specialize in bringing European  universities and Cameroonian students closer. You can find out more about our story <a href="about.html">here</a>.
